## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to center a div using positioning, without flexbox

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.qr-box { 
    background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); 
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 400px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    box-shadow: 0px 14px 20px 20px rgba(31, 50, 81, 0.1);
}
```

### Continued development

I would continue to focus more on flexbox and grid so i can keep creating magic

### Useful resources

- Unfortunately i have no resource to recommend
